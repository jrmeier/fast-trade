    """Analyzes the dataframe and runs sort of a market simulation, entering and exiting positions

    Parameters
    ----------
        df, dataframe from process_dataframe after the actions have been added
        backtest: dict, contains instructions on when to enter/exit trades

    Returns
    -------
        df, returns a dataframe with the new rows processed

    Explainer
    ---------
    This is one of more complex parts of the library. I'm going to try to explain what's going on here.
    Fast Trade uses what's known as "vectorized" backtesting. This is what makes Fast Trade fast. To do that all the
    calculations (datapoints/indicators) are made before this step and all the actions have been generated,
    meaning based on the datapoints alone, the action is determined.(see process_logic_and_action in run_backtest.py).


    At this point, the state of backtest is as follows:
        * datapoints/indicators ARE calculated
        * actions (enter, exit) ARE determined

    What is left is to apply the strategy to our dataframe so we can analyze the perfomance of our strategy. To do this,
    we need to keep track of our account balance and transactions.
